# Description
For this task, I wanted to send an email through Python. I wrote a script that would allow me to send an email from a Gmail account I created for this purpose.
## Languages
* Python

* HTML (very basic)
## Overview
After determining what I felt was the most suitable library to import, I researched how to send the email and let the sender know the email had been sent successfully. This included:
* Overcoming the security features in Gmail that initially prevented me from being able to send an email
* A feedback response on the terminal to let the user know the email was sent
## Points to Note
* My code was written for sending an email through Gmail
  * The process might be different if you use a different email service provider
  * Google takes steps to prevent less secure apps/sites from being able to access the Google Server. You can change the settings here: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
* Due to security concerns, I set up a Gmail account (I didnâ€™t use my personal account) for use with this script and removed any personal information from my published code:
  * There are notes in the code to help you fill in the relevant parts
  * Feel free to use my code, but ensure you remove any personal or sensitive information before publishing it
## Going Forward
This is the first version of this script. I see a lot of potential for extending this script and in the future I look forward to researching and incorporating the following:
* Enhancing the HTML code
* Adding attachments
* Scheduling the emails to be sent at a certain time or with a certain frequency
* Linking to an API to get dynamic content
  * For example, a weather API to tell me what the weather will be like today
